# ChatServer
A simple to use and edit chat server and client.  

It goes without saying that server.js contains the server-side code, and client.html contains the client-side code (including it's CSS and JavaScript).

To start the server all you need to do is `node server.js`.

I also recommend using another program to allow for external IPs to connect to your server. I personally used serveo.net for this.

`ssh -R <a website name>:80:<your ip>:8080 serveo.net`
