# ChatServer
A simple to use and edit chat server and client.  

index.js contains the server-side code, and index.html contains the client-side code (including CSS and JS).

Assuming you have Node.js installed, all you need to do is `node index.js` to start the server up.

I also recommend using another program to allow for external IPs to connect to your server. I personally used serveo.net for this.

`ssh -R <a website name>:80:<your ip>:8080 serveo.net`
