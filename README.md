# ChatServer
A simple to use and edit chat server and client.  

Assuming you have Node.js installed, all you need to do is node index.js to start the server up.

I also recommend using another program to allow for external IPs to connect to your server. I personally used serveo.net for this.

`ssh -R <a website name>:80:<your ip>:8080 serveo.net`
